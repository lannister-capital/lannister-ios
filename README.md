# Lannister iOS 👑

Lannister allows anyone to keep track and analyze the distribution of their holdings both in crypto and fiat (banks, deposits, savings, etc).

💭 Inspiration
We started building Lannister because we needed a way to keep track of our holdings both in crypto and fiat (banks, deposits, savings, etc). It was also fundamental to have security and privacy in mind. No central server that could compromise our identity and financial data.

📊 What it does
Lannister allows anyone to keep track of their holdings, follow its progress and easily analyze their distribution. It's simple to use for anyone who wants to take control of their financial life.

⭐️ Unique features
Convenient: crypto and fiat, all-in-one place (supporting now 12 fiat and 2 crypto currencies with more to come)
Secure: runs locally on your phone, supports biometric access, optionally syncs with secure end-to-end encryption and decentralized storage via Blockstack infrastructure
Open: completely open-source

💻 Platforms
We're building Lannister for iOS and web, though only iOS is available at the moment. Both platforms will be able to sync information via Blockstack's infrastructure and keep information securely stored. Android is also coming in the next months.
